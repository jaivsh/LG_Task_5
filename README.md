## For Task 3(Diwali KML file):
I utilized India's GeoJSON file, which I sourced online, as the foundation for the project. To populate the map with data points, I developed a Python function that generated 1,000 random placemarks and assigned them randomly to one of three distinct styles I had created. These styles were distributed across the placemarks to add variety and visual appeal.

Additionally, I applied a complete Earth overlay to simulate a dark night effect, resulting in a black background. To enhance India's visual outline, I implemented a yellow border around the country. While this border may not be visible under the fully dark overlay, it becomes prominent when the overlay is removed.

## For Task 4(Blender + 3D KML):
I used Blender software to create a 3d model similar to the one given in the UI questionnaire doc file. I developed 2d surfaces in Blender and extruded them to get shapes and then I applied Principled BSDF and Diffused BSDF colors to the surface to get the final output. Then I placed that 3d model in the Sahara Desert using KML and visualized that on Google Earth Pro.
